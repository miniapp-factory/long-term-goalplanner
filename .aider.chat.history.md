A modern, minimalist logo depicting a vertical staircase of blocks ascending, each block slightly larger than the one below, symbolizing progressive goal breakdown. The staircase is set against a gradient background from light blue at the bottom to deep blue at the top, with a subtle drop shadow to give depth. The design is clean, with sharp edges and a slight glow around the top block to emphasize achievement.
